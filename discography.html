    <h1>Aaron Freed&rsquo;s Discography</h1>
    
    <p>I got sick of linking people directly to the <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpA90wfRcJhmDmMSR?e=BnSJGH">OneDrive folder</a> where I&rsquo;ve uploaded all my music: it provides almost no information about each release, and its URL is impossible to remember. So here&rsquo;s a more comprehensive overview with a more memorable URL. Release dates are in ISO format (yyyy-mm-dd, which has the convenient benefit of sorting automatically when entered into a computer file system) when I know the full date. Releases&rsquo; names are followed by their length and TT Dynamic Range Meter score (a higher score indicates less dynamic range compression).</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong class="number">1997</strong> &ndash; <strong><em><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpjOOvto14ZQlL1He?e=oJbueP" target="_blank">Compositions <span class="number">1993-1997</span></a></em></strong> (<span class="number">65:17</span>, DR<span class="number">13</span>, album): These are juvenilia, but I&rsquo;m still proud of parts of them. Saying this has a <span class="number">1997</span> release date might not be strictly accurate, since I went back and revised parts of the arrangements in <span class="number">2008</span>, but the vast majority of it dates to the years listed in the title, and all of this material was previously released (albeit among a small circle of friends and family members). The bulk of this is original composition, but a few are arrangements of a few traditional pieces, and one track, &lsquo;The Colour of Night&rsquo;, was cowritten with a middle/high school friend, Austin Shoemaker.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">1997</strong> &ndash; <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpiobXz51kqObAIqH?e=WogGPt" target="_blank"><strong><em>Marathon Remixes</em></strong> (QuickTime)</a> (<span class="number">39:35</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>, remix album): My first remixes of the <em>Marathon</em> soundtrack. These are extremely faithful to the sound and style of the original tracks, adding only reverb, panning, instrument doubling, and occasional other flourishes to tracks.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">1997</strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRplY1ViolZ8eHpdPq?e=f76MNT" target="_blank">Theme from <em>Marathon Chronicles</em></a></strong> (<span class="number">2:58</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>, single): Two different arrangements of a track from <em>Compositions 1993-1997</em> called &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo;, used as the theme for my still-unfinished scenario <em>Marathon Chronicles</em> (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoysJW6pXQ6k1ExcIEZMIOWc9wfgIkYmL">YouTube</a> for more info).</li>
      <li><strong class="number">2014-11-24</strong> &ndash; <strong><em><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpjvdKmHR_vu5B7k1?e=esgktJ" target="_blank">Demos 2014</a></em></strong> (<span class="number">52:30</span>, DR<span class="number">15</span>, demo album): Competent piano demos featuring an original composition (&lsquo;Love&rsquo;), arrangements of an excerpt from Genesis&rsquo; &lsquo;Supper&rsquo;s Ready&rsquo; and two different Nobuo Uematsu tracks entitled &lsquo;Terra&rsquo; (one from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> and the other from <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>), and two improvisations. Actually, even the original song and covers contain plenty of improvisation.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">2021-01-28</strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpS7At8w7zQvCcKpe?e=cXvcBd" target="_blank"><em>Cadence of Hyrule</em> Future Sound Remixes</a></strong> (<span class="number">91:50</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>, remix album): Counting DLC, <em>Cadence of Hyrule</em> has up to six different versions of its songs, all with identical tempi and melodies. These remixes weave <span class="number">17</span> of its songs into dense, psychedelic listening experiences that are radically different from their sources.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">2021-02-03</strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpkPY16lkubkeNIFW?e=qggFWw" target="_blank"><em>Marathon</em> QuickTime <span class="number">2.0</span> & <span class="number">2.5</span> stereo remix</a></strong> (<span class="number">41:00</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>, remix album): <em>Marathon</em>&rsquo;s soundtrack was originally in mono, and the instrument voices changed slightly between QuickTime <span class="number">2.0</span> and <span class="number">2.5</span>. I put <span class="number">2.0</span> in the left channel and <span class="number">2.5</span> in the right. The result is better than you&rsquo;d expect. The stereo phasing helps.</li>
      <li><strong class="number">2022-12-05</strong> &ndash; <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpiDJtWC0bGx8yRLG?e=Zdkls9" target="_blank"><strong><em>Marathon: Pistol Starts</em></strong> (<em>See You Starside</em> First Drafts)</a> (<span class="number">40:37</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>, remix album): The first <em>Marathon</em> remixes I did in GarageBand. They&rsquo;re less faithful in sound than my <span class="number">1997</span> remixes (I used ton of retro synth voices, especially the Mellotron), but more stylistically faithful than any of my following mixes, which are still based on these. &lsquo;Pistol Start&rsquo; refers to a form of challenge run done by hitting command-option-new game (ctrl-shift-new game on Windows or Linux); a player must complete a level with the starting loadout of a pistol and three clips.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2022-12-07</span> to present</strong> &ndash; <strong><em><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpEIECjVvcyQb2Ijw?e=anBGFH" target="_blank">See You Starside: Interim Revisions</a></em></strong> (<span class="number">155:35</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>, remix/arrangement anthology): Rather than remove old mixes entirely as I supersede them, I&rsquo;ve simply moved them to this folder so that people can trace their evolution. Dates are listed in ISO format, followed by <span class="number">24</span>-hour time (<span class="number">00.00</span> to <span class="number">23.59</span>). My lack of anything that could even charitably be described as a sleep schedule may be apparent from these filenames.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2023</span> (WIP)</strong> &ndash; <strong><em><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRph-QWQl1PmXFYmsh?e=qrMk9B" target="_blank">See You Starside: The Marathon Soundtrack Reimagined</a></em></strong> (<span class="number">73:01</span>, DR<span class="number">13</span>, remix/arrangement album): What began as an endeavour to remix <em>Marathon</em>&rsquo;s soundtrack grew into something more resembling an arranged album, with (as of this count) nearly <span class="number">33</span> minutes of new material. These are dense, intricate mixes; retro synths, dynamic range, reverb, arpeggiation, cross-references to other tracks, and entirely new instrument parts can all be found in copious quantities. The influence of &rsquo;<span class="number">70</span>s progressive rock songwriting and arranging, &rsquo;<span class="number">80</span>s pop production, and &rsquo;<span class="number">90</span>s Japanese game composers should be readily apparent to listeners; there&rsquo;s also occasional influence from genres as disparate as jazz, blues, disco, post-rock, classical, and metal.</li>

      <p>(I&rsquo;m not listing my own albums under this, because lol).</p>

    <h3 id="engineerofficial">Official Releases</h3>

    <p>I mastered or remastered the soundtracks used in official releases of the following game mods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2018-12-21</span></strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRqAP9Ak_FWbCo7wBa?e=mi5WHO" target="_blank"><em>Eternal X</em> <span class="number">1.2</span> OST</a></strong> (<span class="number">1:31:58</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>) by Dr Craig Hardgrove, Tommy T-Bone, Nicholas Singer, and Eike Steffen. The most acclaimed and popular remixes of <em>Marathon</em>&rsquo;s soundtrack, three classic mash-ups of <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Halo</em> tracks, and a few bangin&rsquo; originals. YouTube video <a href="https://youtu.be/LbkpMAZuOk0" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2021-06-19</span></strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/twfg6fk6xuz66jj/AAC0zHDyHZUPELAAbAC8EqEca?dl=1" target="_blank"><em>Trojan</em> Standalone Edition OST</a></strong> (<span class="number">1:57:05</span>, DR<span class="number">15</span>) by Tom Worth, John Carlo Maffei, Jason Aguiar, Steve Campbell, and Hamish Sanderson. Technically, I remastered these tracks, though they&rsquo;re mostly not huge changes from the originals besides having slightly more dynamic range. The biggest change is the inclusion of the credits loop, which I also expanded slightly. (I didn&rsquo;t credit myself for this.) YouTube video <a href="https://youtu.be/bKQnv8zg8rk" target="_blank">here</a>, though it omits the credits loop and &lsquo;Archangael Death&rsquo; for the sake of pacing. My biggest contribution to this release by far was to the sounds, all of which I remastered. This took me <span class="number">20+</span> hours, and the only acknowledgement I got was a &lsquo;thanks&rsquo;; my contributions to the game weren&rsquo;t mentioned anywhere in the credits. I&rsquo;m still annoyed about this.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2020-05-24</span></strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRp2muqlslxdx2Uu_M?e=J4vA5p" target="_blank"><em>Marathon Phoenix</em> OST</a></strong> (<span class="number">1:38:42</span>, DR<span class="number">11</span>) by Kevin MacLeod</strong> and CryoS. Included with <em>Phoenix</em> as of version <span class="number">1.4</span>, released <span class="number">2022-01-19</span>. (<em>Phoenix</em> <span class="number">1.4.1</span>, released <span class="number">2023-01-05</span>, is the latest release.) YouTube video <a href="https://youtu.be/KczNQR_K5Qc" target="_blank">here</a>. I also remastered the sounds, which you can get <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2hepwmp5a9ig8kh/Marathon%20Phoenix%20Remastered%20Sounds%20%26%20Music.7z">here</a>. This also includes a remastered version of the theme music.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2022-09-19</span></strong> &ndash; <strong><em><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRnlBlixD0iXLX3NNO?e=r8YAh5" target="_blank">dungeons presents hellpak: Vol. <span class="number">1</span> &ndash; Not Recommended by Doctors</a></em></strong> (<span class="number">2:03:46</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>) by tbcr, Matrix_XV, CKT<span class="number">1138</span>, and NEFX. The official soundtrack, including ten tracks not used in the game. Each track has unique artwork generated with Midjourney. I strongly recommend watching the <a href="https://youtu.be/djme8sJfwOo" target=""_blank>YouTube video</a> to get the full experience.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2023</span> (WIP)</strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpnli8zolUcqCjXEA?e=bZtayh" target="_blank"><em>dungeons presents hellpak: Vol. <span class="number">1</span> &ndash; Not Recommended by Doctors</em> DLC</a></strong> (<span class="number">54:35</span>, DR<span class="number">11</span>) by Matrix_XV, tbcr, and CKT<span class="number">1138</span>. Technically not a soundtrack, but it&rsquo;ll be an official release once we finalise it. It contains remixes and demos of <em>Vol. <span class="number">1</span></em> tracks, plus standalone versions of tracks with gapless transitions on the OST.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2023</span> (WIP)</strong> &ndash; <strong><em><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRpl4XwALWtP2PbwBB?e=luFHG5" target="_blank">dungeons presents hellpak: Vol. <span class="number">2</span> &ndash; An Exercise in Questionable Taste</a></em></strong> (<span class="number">2:23:51</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>) by Matrix_XV, tbcr, CKT<span class="number">1138</span>, and Aaron Freed. Will also contain several NEFX tracks, but I don&rsquo;t currently have them. We have not even begun to consider the song order yet, so these are not tagged with song numbers. Some of these songs will likely be cut from the final release, though some of those will probably be held over for <em>Vol. 3</em>.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2023</span> (WIP)</strong> &ndash; <strong><strong><em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> OST</strong></strong> (<span class="number">2:34:45</span>, DR<span class="number">11</span>) by Alexander Nakarada, Rafael Krux, Kevin MacLeod, Bryan Teoh, Nine Inch Nails, Brian Boyko, Sean Magee, Rich Wilcox, and Fungus Amongus (forthcoming). <em>Tempus Irae Redux</em> is nearing the end of its development and will likely be released in early to mid-<span class="number">2023</span>.</li>
      <li><strong><span class="number">2023</span> (WIP)</strong> &ndash; <strong><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuD0MykSsmaRnUJawmCYx8my2zSS?e=9rRYFa" target="_blank"><em>Eternal X</em> <span class="number">1.3</span> OST</a></strong> (<span class="number">6:03:36</span>, DR<span class="number">12</span>) by Aaron Freed, Dr Craig Hardgrove, wowbobwow, Talashar, wowbobwow, CKT<span class="number">1138</span>, Solar-Tron, Dan Storm, Matrix_XV, Tommy T-Bone, Nicholas Singer, Eike Steffen, and Trey J. Anderson. <span class="number">1.3</span> is still under construction, though it&rsquo;ll likely be finished in mid- to late <span class="number">2023</span>.</li>
