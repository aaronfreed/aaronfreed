Iâ€™m a political science and cybersecurity major from Sarasota, FL. Amateur game development, music (re)mastering, and writing consume much of my spare time.

I have at least cursory knowledge of the following languages:

* English (obviously)
* Spanish
* Latin
* German
* C#
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* Lua
* Java

More to come when I feel like updating this further.
